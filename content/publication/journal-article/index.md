abstract: Satellite-derived solar irradiance is advantageous in solar resource assessment due to its high spatiotemporal availability, but its discrepancies to ground-observed values remain an issue for reliability. Site adaptation can be employed to correct these errors by using short-term high-quality ground-observed values. Recent studies have highlighted the benefits of the sequential procedure of a regressive and a distribution-mapping technique in comparison to their individual counterparts. In this paper, we attempted to improve the sequential procedure by using various distribution mapping techniques in addition to the previously proposed quantile mapping. We applied these site-adaptation techniques on the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI) obtained from the UASIBS-KIER model in Daejeon, South Korea. The best technique, determined by a ranking methodology, can reduce the mean bias from &minus;5.04% and 13.51% to &minus;0.45% and &minus;2.02% for GHI and DNI, respectively, and improve distribution similarity by 2.5 times and 4 times for GHI and DNI, respectively. Partial regression and residual plot analysis were attempted to examine our finding that the sequential procedure is better than individual techniques for GHI, whereas the opposite is true for DNI. This is an initial study to achieve generalized site-adaptation techniques for the UASIBS-KIER model output.

abstract: Site adaptation has become a necessary step in resource assessment for ensuring the bankability of a renewable energy project. The process involves collecting short-term observation data to correct the long-term dataset available from the satellite-derived models, which could thus provide a more accurate estimate of the solar resource data. This study aims to enhance the site-adaptation of direct normal irradiance, as its correction remains notably challenging in comparison to global horizontal irradiance due to its larger error, which is often attributed to the complexity of cloud modeling. A new methodology for site-adaptation is proposed that exploits the use of a new indicator variable that describes the correctness of sky-condition classification by the clear-sky index. This variable has dual applications within the context of site adaptation: firstly, it is employed in the two-step binning procedure subsequent to the conventional clear-sky binning during preprocessing, and secondly, it serves as an additional input feature in machine-learning-based site adaptation. The results show that the former method can reduce the mean bias error to a mere 0.4%, while the latter is better for reducing large discrepancies as shown by the lower root mean squared error.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study introduces a variable--an indicator of sky-condition classification correctness--to be applied in two novel methodologies of site-adaptation. The use of this variable resulting in improved performance, notably in the substantial reduction of MBE toward a near-perfect value (almost 0).

abstract: Site-adaptation corrects long-term satellite-derived solar irradiance datasets, which improve solar power system modeling by reducing the risks in performance estimation. This study begins with a data-efficient approach to probabilistic site-adaptation, using simple model averaging to quantify uncertainties in the corrected dataset. The proposed model reduces the continuous ranked probability score of up to 34 W/m2 and decreases the bias to nearly 50 % of the initial value. The model performance is associated with the quality of cloud modeling or the seasonal variations of meteorological parameters. In the next phase, the output from the site-adaptation model is employed to develop a probabilistic method for estimating economic performance with a skewed normal distribution. This approach is demonstrated in a case study of a photovoltaic system in South Korea under power purchase agreement (PPA). The evaluation of the distributional economic performance shows that the estimated values are generally aligned with the observational data with a high degree of probability and exhibit greater accuracy than initial estimates. This correction of economic performance estimation is crucial, as evidenced by the demonstration that it can increase the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) to satisfy a specific requirement (e.g., DSCR >1.3), and turn a negative net present value positive, thereby suggesting a shift in the evaluation of projects from economically infeasible to feasible. Sensitivity analysis shows that the economic performance indexes are highly influenced by the PPA price, debt ratio, and total installation cost.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study uses probabilistic approaches, from solar resource assessment to feasibility study. Probabilistic estimates for techno-economic indicators are generated. Finally, a case study of a hypothetical photovoltaic project based on power purchase agreement is presented. The study shows that probabilistic approach played a key role in the project's feasibility, aligned with the observational data with a high degree of probability and exhibit greater accuracy than initial estimates.
