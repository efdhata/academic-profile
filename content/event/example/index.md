summary: How site-adaptation affects PV project feasibility parameters.
abstract: 'Tilted or plane of array solar irradiance (POA) is an important component to be considered in feasibility studies for photovoltaic (PV) plant projects. The POA is derived from the global horizontal irradiance (GHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI), and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI), which can be obtained through ground measurements or satellite model outputs. The University of Arizona Solar Irradiance Based on Satellite-Korea Institute Energy Research (UASIBS-KIER) model produced the GHI, while DNI and DHI can be obtained through decomposition models. The accuracy of satellite models can be improved by site-adaptation models. However, the correction for DNI is currently unsatisfactory, and a new approach utilizing a machine learning algorithm and an alternative decomposition and site-adaptation model is being pursued to improve accuracy. Utilizing various decomposition and site-adaptation models, a collection of time-series solar irradiance data with various levels of deviation is built. The resulting POA and thus the PV power produced are expected to vary, providing a range of possible outcomes in annual energy production and the net present value of a PV plant project.'
