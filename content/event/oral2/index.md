summary: Improving DNI site-adaptation by using a sky-condition classification accuracy indicator.
abstract: 'Site adaptation has become a necessary step in resource assessment for ensuring the bankability of a renewable energy project. The process involves collecting short-term observation data to correct the long-term dataset available from the satellite-derived models, which could thus provide a more accurate estimate of feasibility in both energy and financial performance. A new methodology is proposed that exploits the use of a new indicator variable that describes the correctness of sky-condition classification by the clear-sky index. The variable can be used in two ways: (i) in the preprocessing of site adaptation, it is used for binning procedure subsequent to the conventional clear-sky binning, and (ii) in machine-learning-based site adaptation as a new input variable (features). The results show that the former method can reduce the mean bias error to a mere 0.4%, while the latter is better for reducing larger discrepancies shown by the root mean squared error. The details from the results will be shown in the upcoming conference.'
